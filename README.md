# Itos-Lemma-Option-Pricing-Stochastic-Volatility

This project is an implementation of Geometric Brownian Motion for observation of their main features. Moreover, Monte-Carlo simulation is used for option pricing with the assumptions of the GBM model.

Then, a dynamic hedging simulation is implemented in order to observe the accuracy of delta hedging. 

Finally, Heston model is implemented in order to incorporate stochastic volatilities. Same option pricing and dynamic delta hedging simulations are applied to the model, as well.
